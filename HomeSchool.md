(Update 07-14-2021) Couple nights ago we went to Po Shen Loh's talk at the Tiles park on math, game theory and an app his team created called NoVid (to counter Covid spread using math and contact tracing)

He also answered questions at the end. Some take aways I got:  
1) Think always one step above. For example, the audience asked how to be careful about doing multiple choice questions in SAT, and he said try to be careful or (meticulate, I added this word) when doing everything in life. I think this is appliable to chess game, and many things in life too. Baiscally we want to do some deep work or thinking instead of shallow work. When Dr. Loh mentioned he likes the math competiton problem better than the textbook problems, and I think he meant those are more difficult problems and basically it's more interesting for him.  

2) Focus and not easisy give up (persistence). I think for today's kids and grownups, the focus part hits the nail on the head, due to distractions such as smartphone and social media. In fact I read something along those lines yesterday on another source: basically the touch screen and scroll is a bit like watching TV or smoke the opium (from what the author said), on the other hand, pen or keyboard will make the user be more intensional (for example, I am typing this via keyboard) and it's creation (or thinking, or deep work, hopefully).  More on this later.

**Two math / algorithm problems**  
1. I rememeber this problem as it was the middle school entrance exam when I graduating from 5th grade in Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province. This is the last problem on the Math test and I believe very few kids solved it: I did not solved it during the exam either. Here it goes...
It takes 1 hour from Peter to walk from point A to point B; it takes Mike 2 hours to walk from point B to A. If they start at the same time, Peter from point A walking toward point B, Mike started at point B walking toward A. How long will it take before they meet (assume point A to B is a straight line).

2. I rememeber this problem as it was the key algorithm (or gotcha) problem when I was interview for my first programmer job. It seems like a widely used problem. Here it goes... 
There are 8 balls, one is heavier than the rest 7, and there is a scale balance that can tell which side is heavier. Try to use as fewer attempts possible to find the "heavier" ball. This ball can be expanded to something like this: if one has 3 chances, how many (as many as possible) balls can he / she have to find out the lone "heavier" ball?
