(Update 07-14-2021) Couple nights ago we went to Po Shen Loh's talk at the Tiles park on math, game theory and an app his team created called NoVid (to counter Covid spread using math and contact tracing)

He also answered questions at the end. Some take aways I got:  
1) Think always one step above. For example, the audience asked how to be careful about doing multiple choice questions in SAT, and he said try to be careful or (meticulate, I added this word) when doing everything in life. I think this is appliable to chess game, and many things in life too. Baiscally we want to do some deep work or thinking instead of shallow work. When Dr. Loh mentioned he likes the math competiton problem better than the textbook problems, and I think he meant those are more difficult problems and basically it's more interesting for him.  

2) Focus and not easisy give up (persistence). I think for today's kids and grownups, the focus part hits the nail on the head, due to distractions such as smartphone and social media. In fact I read something along those lines yesterday on another source: basically the touch screen and scroll is a bit like watching TV or smoke the opium (from what the author said), on the other hand, pen or keyboard will make the user be more intensional (for example, I am typing this via keyboard) and it's creation (or thinking, or deep work, hopefully).  More on this later.
