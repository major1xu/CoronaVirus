How to quickly build a mobile friendly restaurant website

Note this is very much relevant as restaurants are shutting down the dining for the most part due to the pandemic. 

Some restaurant may already have built the websites (Pickleman came to mind) or apps (Five Guys etc), with the help of a 3rd 
party etc. There are room for improvement (5 guys came to mind, it does not store CC, which means the customer need to enter 
or scan the card everytime placing an order).
