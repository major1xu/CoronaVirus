# CoronaVirus
CoronaVirus 101 

Since late Dec 2019, the Corona Virus gradually became an outbreak in Wuhan City as well as Hubei Province. Please note Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and has a 
population of 11 million. When the city is shutdown in Jan 23 (2 days before Chinese new year Jan 25), there was still 9 millon people in Wuhan. More than 2 million people left
Wuhan and headed to other cities or towns, or villiages in Hubei province. The Virus has claimed almost 3,000 people's lives in China, again mostly in Wuhan / Hubei. There were 
about 80,000 confirmed cases, mostly in China, with the overseas outbreak seems more like a reality (Iran, Italy and South Korea). 

The US, being the most advanced / powerful country and half way across the globe from China, had about 62 confirmed cases, but the recent worry is there is such thing called 
community based transmission (people cannot tell where they got virus). 

I am not a doctor nor a scientist: but I am an engieer that is trained in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST, incidentally based in Wuhan). HUST is considered as
one of the best engineering colleges in China. I am pragmatic software engineer with about 20 years of engineering experience in the US. Reading the news on Corona Virus is not 
easy, as I still have family and friends in China including Wuhan. But we all learn more as time goes (as long as we like to learn from the experts). 

Ways to prevent the infection
Wash hands, avoid rub eyes, noses, and mouths. When coughing cover with elbow (not hand or not cough openly)

Avoid crowd, for example, concert, games, marathon races. Avoid close contact with people. 

Avoid places that have a lot of people using the central air, a good example is the cruise ship.

Deadth rate
The current overall death rate is about 2%, which is higher than the so called 0.1% deadth rate in the US. Both numbers can be skcrewed though. The 2% rate needs to be re-examined
because the initial death rate in Wuhan / Hubei was high due to overwhelming of the healthcare facilities. So a lot people probably would have survived if they were in Zhejiang
province (my hometown) between Jan 20 to Feb 10. The healthcare facilities and people issues are solved by the help from all over the country. Also it takes sometime for the 
doctor to come up with ways to treat or allieviate the symptoms. 


Cure
There is no known medicine. There is some experiment medicines, such as the HIV medicine or the Gilead new medicine. The more important part, seems to me, from watching a video
of Wuhan hospital, is to have an uplifting spritit and listen to the doctor (good doctor :-)

So that did the doctor say: basically they told the patient to fight while be positive. The reporotory disease is usually painful, from my personal experience. The doctors and 
nurses tried to help the patient be positive, by talking to them, by encouraging them to use the device properly, or to partiipate some group activies.
