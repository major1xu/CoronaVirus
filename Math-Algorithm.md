math / algorithm problems

1. I rememeber this problem as it was the middle school entrance exam when I graduating from 5th grade in Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province. This is the last problem on the Math test and I believe very few kids solved it: I did not solved it during the exam either. Here it goes... It takes 1 hour from Peter to walk from point A to point B; it takes Mike 2 hours to walk from point B to A. If they start at the same time, Peter from point A walking toward point B, Mike started at point B walking toward A. How long will it take before they meet (assume point A to B is a straight line). I will put the answer in the end.  

2. I rememeber this problem as it was the key algorithm (or gotcha) problem when I was interview for my first programmer job. It seems like a widely used problem. Here it goes... There are 8 balls, one is heavier than the rest 7, and there is a scale balance that can tell which side is heavier. Try to use as fewer attempts possible to find the "heavier" ball. This ball can be expanded to something like this: if one has 3 chances, how many (as many as possible) balls can he / she have to find out the lone "heavier" ball?

3. A geometry problem sent in by Dylan / LeeLee (https://megsss.org/elements-program), I will put a link of picture because a picture is worth 2,000 words in geometry

4. The riddle / lock problem Serenity saw from Ted (this is the link: https://www.ted.com/talks/lisa_winer_can_you_solve_the_locker_riddle/transcript?language=en#:~:text=He%20explains%3A%20Every%20relative%20is,%2C%20she'll%20open%20it. || This is the story: Your rich, eccentric uncle just passed away, and you and your 99 nasty relatives have been invited to the reading of his will. He wanted to leave all of his money to you, but he knew that if he did, your relatives would pester you forever. So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything you need to know about riddles. Your uncle left the following note in his will: "I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it together, you will share the money evenly. However, if you are the first to find the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance all to yourself. Good luck." The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives to a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word. He explains: Every relative is assigned a number from 1 to 100. Heir 1 will open every locker. Heir 2 will then close every second locker. Heir 3 will change the status of every third locker, specifically if it's open, she'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until all 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain open at the end will help you crack the code for the safe. Before cousin Thaddeus can even start down the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer you know which lockers will remain open. But how? Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself! || I was able to solve this in the car, I felt this problem is simialr to problem 2 above)

5. I recall there was an old geomtry or math problems (may need to go through my photos on iPhone or wechat moments), some sort of math competition. I need to save them here so that I can build on it as time goes... I have 2 problems in my gmail https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#label/math/QgrcJHrnrnFVhbGpmpSnpFNCqKhcxZmLhlq

6. A brain teaser kind of question at GregTang math (I just heard bout GregTang and the problem recently at a school event): use 6, 7, 8 and 9, plus any addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to make the result of calculation as 10 (only use each number once, can use any kind of parenthesis as needed). I saw a few kids come up with answers (but it seems to me some answers are from the parents 🙂 I tried but could not come up with answer as 10 at the spot. Note we, my wife and I, when we were kids in China did similar exercise / games using the poker (draw 4 kids, instead of 10, we need to make 24). On my way home, or at home (this is how things work for me, just like how I come up with the solutions to coding at work), I have this: (7+8)x6/9=10 Note: there should be many ways / combinations to this, the one I heard at the gathering is 8x(9-7)-6=10 After that I followed GregTang on twitter, and I worked on some of the puzzles there from time to time: those are not "too hard" problems, but nonetheless interesting / educational for the kids (I think).

10. Not to confuse with problem 2: You have 5 jars of pills. Each pill weighs 10 grams, except for contaminated pills contained in one jar, where each pill weighs 9 grams. Given a scale, how could you tell which jar had the contaminated pills in just one measurement?

12. https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1627597944546271237 - Klein read 30 pages of the book on Monday and 1/8 of the book on Tuesday. He completed the remaing 1/4 of the book on Wednesday. How many pages are there in the book?  

13. There are 5 bottles of tablets (drugs) and each bottle has 100 pills. We know one bottle is contaminated and the pill in that bottle is different from the other 4 bottles. We have a scale that can be used to weigh the pills and we can only use the scale once, how do we find out the bottle that has contaminated drugs (pills)?
